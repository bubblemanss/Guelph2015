# Guelph2015

http://open.guelph.ca/guelph-hackathon-2015/

Post your ideas here. It should have the following things in order to make it easy for everyone to understand:
- idea
- theme its relating to
- brief summary of how you think we should implement it
- your name (so we know who to ask about it)

The implementation of the idea we can improve on if we choose the idea.

Themes:
- Theme 1: Solid Waste collection schedule (seems easiest to do)
- Theme 2: Solid Waste sorting tool
- Theme 3: Guelph Transit adopt a bus stop
- Theme 4: Guelph Transit managing bus stop amenities 

Ideas:
- Theme2: Create an app that lets people identify which bin their garbage goes into. It can have a search bar option for people to type in the item, and it can have the option to use a barcode scanner built into the app. This way, they dont have to type it in. We can include like cached memory for frequently or recently chosen items and bookmarks so they wouldn't need to keep typing in the item. Maybe include something like stickers or like leveling up when committing an item to the app. (Jonathan & Malcom!)

- Scheduled Reminders : Theme1 : Create a Web application that basically works as a reminder for the user. Users would sign up and choose how they would like to be reminded (ie text, email, maybe expand to more platforms). And once they sign up they will be able to view the schedule and print it, etc. ( Pretty much the requirments) [Malcom]

- Informative/Forum based website for : Theme4: Basically a website that, upon registration, will allow users to not only see a map of all the bus stops in guelph but once clicked information about the amenities and adoptted/avaliable stops. Also allows users to issue complaints or suggestions that will be emailed to the guelph transit people. [Malcom]
