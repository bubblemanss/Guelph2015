# Guelph2015

http://open.guelph.ca/guelph-hackathon-2015/

Post your ideas here. It should have the following things in order to make it easy for everyone to understand:
- idea
- theme its relating to
- brief summary of how you think we should implement it
- your name (so we know who to ask about it)

The implementation of the idea we can improve on if we choose the idea.

Themes:
- Theme 1: Solid Waste collection schedule (seems easiest to do)
- Theme 2: Solid Waste sorting tool
- Theme 3: Guelph Transit adopt a bus stop
- Theme 4: Guelph Transit managing bus stop amenities 

Ideas:
- Theme2: Create an app that lets people identify which bin their garbage goes into. It can have a search bar option for people to type in the item, and it can have the option to use a barcode scanner built into the app. This way, they dont have to type it in. We can include like cached memory for frequently or recently chosen items and bookmarks so they wouldn't need to keep typing in the item. Maybe include something like stickers or like leveling up when committing an item to the app. (Jonathan & Malcom!)
